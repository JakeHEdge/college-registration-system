# College Registration System

## Overview

A role-based academic registration platform built using Java and MySQL.  
The system simulates a real-world college administration environment, implementing secure authentication, relational schema design, and modular object-oriented architecture to manage student and teacher workflows.

## Tech Stack

- Java
- MySQL
- JDBC
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Key Features

- Role-based login system (Admin & Teacher access)
- Student record management
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Relational database integration
- Modular OOP structure for maintainability

## Architecture

- Layered separation between business logic and data access
- JDBC used for database connectivity
- Relational schema designed to maintain data integrity
- Role-based access control enforced at authentication level

## Challenges & Solutions

- Designing relational tables to prevent data duplication
- Implementing secure login validation for multiple user roles
- Maintaining consistent CRUD operations across database transactions

These were addressed through structured schema planning and modular class design.
